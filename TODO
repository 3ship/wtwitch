===> NEXT RELEASE GOAL <===
- Add bash completion
- When using `wtwitch c`, cache the json and not the formatted files
  - This will better facilitate bash completion so as to not waste API calls
  - This will make it so that if the user resizes a terminal during the 60 second
    cache cooldown, the output will always be rerendered to the correct terminal width

===<<< FUTURE >>>===
- Add command to list and watch VODs from a specified channel
    wtwitch v[od] [channel] (creates numbered list of vods?)
    wtwitch v[od] [channel] [number]
    Move wtwitch v[ersion] to full wtwitch version, no v[]
- Allow browsing more than one page of t/g results
    https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-games
    e.g. wtwitch g overwatch next
    Using wtwitch g without a "next" should reset pagination value
